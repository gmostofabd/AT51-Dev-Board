		<h3>Introduction:</h3>
          <blockquote>
		  <p>
            We are very familiar with “Hello world!” basic program code in the initial 
            stage of any programming language to learn some basic things. Similarly to 
            get started with any Microcontroller, LED interfacing is a basic and simplest 
            experiment to see a physical output.
            
            <br><br>Each Microcontroller is different in its architecture, but the 
            interfacing concepts are almost same for all. One can understand the concept 
            of input-output configurations of the general-purpose I/O port in a 
            microcontroller with the simple LED blinking project. This tutorial will 
            explain the method of interfacing LEDs with 8051 microcontrollers.

        <h3>How it works?</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            The symbol of LED is formed by merging the symbol of P-N Junction diode and outward
             arrows. These outward arrows symbolise the light radiated by the light emitting diode.
             
             <br><br>
        
             From the above figure we can have a lot of information regarding LED. The longer leg 
             is Anode and the smaller one is cathode pin. There will be a notch on the surface 
             indicates cathode side. Another process to determine the anode cathode pin if you see 
             inside, the cathode plate is larger than the anode plate. The anode cathode pin can 
             also be identified using a multi-meter or a 5V power supply unit.
          
          <br><br>From the chart at right of above figure we can see that each LED has its own 
          forward voltage drop across the PN junction and this parameter which is determined by 
          the semiconductor material used, is the forward voltage drop for a specified amount of 
          forward conduction current, typically for a forward current of 20mA.
        </p>
        </blockquote>


        <h3>LED Series Resistors:</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In most cases LEDs are operated from a low voltage DC supply, with a series resistor, 
            Rs used to limit the forward current to a safe value from say 5mA for a simple LED 
            indicator to 30mA or more where a high brightness light output is needed.
            
            <br><br>The series resistor value R is calculated by simply using Ohm´s Law, by 
            knowing the required forward current I of the LED, the supply voltage VS across the 
            combination and the expected forward voltage drop of the LED, VF at the required 
            current level, the current limiting resistor is calculated as below:

        <h3>Circuit Discussion :</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Here is the circuit diagram of the AT89S51 interfaced 2 LEDs on two different PORT Pins. 
                One is connected to PORT-0 at PIN-7 and second one is connected  to PORT2 PIN0 of the 
                Microcontroller. Both the LEDs are driven through resistors for limiting current.
                
                <br><br>The image shown above is directly screen capture from our Proteus simulation.
                By observing the simulator markers (i.e. red and blue squares expresses logic 1 and 
                logic 0 accordingly.) When the both LED are ON we can see one of our port pin is 
                showing high or logic 1 while other one is logic 0. It is happening due to to 
                connection logic of the LEDs. We have connected the cathode pin of LED1 (D1) to the 
                microcontroller pin. So, we need to make the corresponding pin low to illuminate the 
                LED. And for the LED2 (D2) which is vice versa as is its reverse connection configuration.

                <br><br>In this microcontroller, pin source current is limited to 10mA per pin 
                (please refer datasheet). So even if the resistor is not provided with LED, there will 
                not be any damage to the LEDs. But in good practice the resistor is always used.

                <br><br>For our case the circuit diagram is as follows. The circuit schematic has drawn 
                over PROTEUS software. The circuit is nothing but same as figure above except the 
                mandatory circuit part of a 8051 microcontroller.
            </p>

        <h3>Code Discussion:</h3>
            <blockquote>
            <p>
                The code lines are properly commented as and when it is required. Assumed that, the 
                comments are sufficient to inform you about the corresponding line of instruction. 
                The delay function at the end creates a nominal delay in blinking the LEDs. The accurate 
                value of time delay could be calculated with the known value of instruction execution 
                time but is not done here since it is beyond the scope of this article. Each time when 
                this function is called in main a delay is generated.

        <h3>Post Run Discussion:  LED Chaser (Code Optimization)</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            A problem can be solved in multiple ways having different efficiencies. Beginnersmay skip 
            the efficiency issues but in good programming practices alternates arealways a thirst of 
            developers. Below is an example of some ways out for a sameoperation.

          <br><br>Example : Write code that will run 8 LEDs on a port one by one at a predefinedinterval.
